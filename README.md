# Shop - React App

E-Commerce project was made with using React. I wanted to build a multi-page website instead of the typical single-page application supported by React.JS, so followed Udemy Course "Complete React Developer (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)" as well as the React Tutorial to integrate React Router into the project. Learning from example, figured out how to change url of every link in the application for going into different page.
